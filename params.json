{"name":"Latex-homework-template","tagline":"A multi-column, landscape-oriented LaTeX template for homework assignments","body":"LaTeX homework template\r\n=======================\r\n\r\nA LaTeX template that I used during graduate school for my homework assignments.\r\nLays the problems out in a double-column landscape style.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n-------\r\n- homework.tex is the main template file. At the beginning you will find many fields that should be personalized, such as:\r\n\t1. Name\r\n\t2. Class name\r\n\t3. Date\r\n\t4. etc..\r\n- The main template file imports the actual markup for the problems from `problems.tex`. This is where each problem should be typed out.\r\n- The syntax for laying out each problem using this template is:\r\n\r\n```latex\r\n\\begin{homeworkProblem}\r\n\t% Homework code\r\n\t% Goes\r\n\t% Here\r\n\\end{homeworkProblem}\r\n``` \r\n\r\n- [Example 1](example_1.md) and [Example 2](example_2.md) show examples of the template used on two complete homework sets, including the use of figures.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
